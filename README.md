👋 Hi, I’m @f00Vmey, but you can call me Foomey

👀 I’m interested in coding in batch and python mainly. I like the idea of pen testing, finding all the flaws of a system

and finding a way to exploit them 🤖

📕 I am currently trying to learn how code python better, and learn PS1 and VBA. 😁

📫 You can talk to me by email "foomey13@gmail.com" or discord "foomey__"

😄 Pronouns: My pronouns are he/him.

👌Thank you for stopping by my page!
